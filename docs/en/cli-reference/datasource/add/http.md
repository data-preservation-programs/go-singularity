NAME:
   singularity datasource add http - HTTP

USAGE:
   singularity datasource add http [command options] <dataset_name> <source_path>

DESCRIPTION:
   --http-headers
      Set HTTP headers for all transactions.
      
      Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.
      
      The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs.  Standard
      [CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) may be used.
      
      For example, to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or '"Cookie","name=value"'.
      
      You can set multiple headers, e.g. '"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.

   --http-no-head
      Don't use HEAD requests.
      
      HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing.
      If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
      Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
      directory listing to:
      
      - find its size
      - check it really exists
      - check to see if it is a directory
      
      If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will mean
      that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone won't have the times or
      sizes of any files, and some files that don't exist may be in the listing.

   --http-no-slash
      Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.
      
      Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
      directories.
      
      A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
      between files and directories.  If this flag is set, then rclone will
      treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
      URLs from them rather than downloading them.
      
      Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
      directories.

   --http-url
      URL of HTTP host to connect to.
      
      E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a username and password.
